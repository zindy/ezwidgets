# Introduction #
From time to time, I have had to develop custom widgets, which other people might find a use for. A lot of these came about in projects related to image processing and interfaces used in pharmaceutical / medical applications, so there might be a recognisable "theme" to my widgets. Don't be put off by this, there are also UI elements not specifically tied to any field.

I will try and keep all the widgets self-contained so that they can be downloaded individually.

The license used here is MIT, until google adds the wxwidgets/wxpython license. If you need the code relicensed under a different license, please contact me.

# Widgets #
The following widgets are made available:
  * A wxpython control to choose a Look-up table LutCtrl
  * A dynamic task bar graph icon IconBar
  * my version of foldable panels (XP style) FoldPanel
  * my version of treebook TreeBook
  * ColumnSorterMixin with a Virtual wx.ListCtrl VirtualList
  * serial mouse polling SerialMouse
  * my additions to the venerable PyPlot
  * ... and more. When I get round to it, that is.
