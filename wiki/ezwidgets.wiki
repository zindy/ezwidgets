#summary A collection of wxpython widgets I have developed over the years.

= Introduction =
From time to time, I have had to develop custom widgets, which other people might find a use for. A lot of these came about in projects related to image processing and interfaces used in pharmaceutical / medical applications, so there might be a recognisable "theme" to my widgets. Don't be put off by this, there are also UI elements not specifically tied to any field.

I will try and keep all the widgets self-contained so that they can be downloaded individually.

The "license" used here is BSD, until google adds the wxwidgets/wxpython license. If you need to relicense the code  under a different license, please contact me.

Another great resource for custom widgets may be found here:
