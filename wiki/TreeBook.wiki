#summary Treebook widget (wizard + tree)

= Introduction =

I can't remember where I saw this widget and thought it was a really good idea. Maybe it was in "Powertoys for Windows XP". I think some old Redhat installs had something similar too.

Basically, one can quickly find a section using the tree, or start from the first one and move to the next page using the buttons.
