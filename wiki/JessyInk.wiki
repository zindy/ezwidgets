#summary Ideas on the JessyInk Inkscape extension

= Introduction =

These are my additions to the [https://launchpad.net/jessyink JessyInk] extension. Nothing exciting, just some random ideas I thought might be useful, and then had great fun implementing.

= !JessyInk navigation =

Bulk of my additions: added a few navigational shortcuts to make my life easier. Listed here are _all_ the navigational shortcuts available, as of version 1.2.0 (yet to be released).

== In slide mode ==

Moving backward and forward using set transitions:
  * *space* and *left click* move to the next slide
  * *left* and *right* move back and forward one slide

Moving backward and forward without transitions:
  * *up* and *down* move back and forward one slide
  * *page up* and *page down* move back and forward one slide
  * *scroll wheel up* and *scroll wheel down* move back and forward one slide

Switching to index mode:
  * *i* toggles from _slide_ to _index_ mode

== In index mode ==

Zooming in and out:
  * *0* reset zoom level (default zoom set to 4 slides across instead of 3?)
  * *-* zoom out (display more slides)
  * *+* or *=* zoom in (display less slides)

Moving around:
  * *up*, *down*, *left*, *right* arrows to select a slide
  * *page up* and *page down* move back and forward one page
  * *scroll wheel up* and *scroll wheel down* move back and forward one page

Selecting a slide:
  * *i* or *enter* toggles from _index_ to _slide_ mode, selecting the highlighted slide
  * *left click* selects a slide

== Issues ==

Currently, clicking on a slide in index mode causes problems. You can click on a slide, but then the mouse wheel events stop working. The anchor part of the URL gets messed-up too: an extra "1" is added to the anchor. Not sure why...

= Titles =

Would be nice to be able to set slides titles (code tentatively scheduled for revision 1.3.0). Hannes Hochreiner had a go, and his current effort works in Safari but not in Opera or Firefox. No crashes though, which is always a bonus!

Hannes's work can be found in the [https://code.launchpad.net/~hannes-hochreiner/jessyink/set-page-title set-page-title] branch. Latest idea is to

  _implement page titles using title tags in the svg tag. Works in Safari, but not in !FireFox and Opera. However, does not cause error, when it fails._

I tried using a
{{{
<title id='title'>This is the title</title>
}}}
tag in the SVG document, which displays a title, but I can't seem to be able to change it. My idea was to define a
{{{
var TITLE = document.getElementById(&quot;title&quot;);
}}}
and then maybe use a
{{{
function update(e)
{
    TITLE.data = slides[activeSlide][&quot;label&quot;];
}
}}}

Like I said... just an idea :-)

= My code so far=

My current musings are available from the googlecode SVN (until we merge all the changes back into the main !JessyInk tree in June):

http://code.google.com/p/ezwidgets/source/browse/#svn/trunk/jessyink

= Example presentation =

An example presentation (using my modified extension) is available here:

= Conclusion =

This concludes my !JessyInk effort. If you would like to leave a message, I'll be glad to read it. Code reviews / contributions / ideas are most welcome. Hopefully in a couple of weeks, the new (working) additions will be merged in !JessyInk.

Regards,
Egor
