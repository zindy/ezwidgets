See also JessyInkKeyboard for keyboard navigation.

== In slide mode ==

Moving backward and forward using set transitions:
  * *left click* move to the next slide

Moving backward and forward without transitions:
  * *scroll wheel up* and *scroll wheel down* move back and forward one slide

== In index mode ==

Moving around:
  * *scroll wheel up* and *scroll wheel down* move back and forward one page

Selecting a slide:
  * *left click* selects a slide
