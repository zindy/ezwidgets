#summary My additions to pyplot

= Introduction =

One could use matplotlib but sometimes, pyplot will do just fine... although a few tweaks here and there might be necessary. I thought I might as well publish all the tweaks in my very own (almost certainly useless) version of pyplot called... ezplot!


= Details =

Latest addition is antialiasing, which uses the wx.GCDC class.

Result is nice antialiased curves, but for anything more involved than a few hundred points, you'll be  better off with matplotlib. Yes, it's that slow... Which means, try the 25000 points demo (Draw4) at your own risk!  Having said that, I noticed that Ubuntu is faster than XP, although XP doesn't try to antialias vertical / horizontal lines (see screenshots below). This will require more testing I guess.

This is how I did it (using the AlphaDrawing demo as a template):

Where needed, I replaced

{{{
        if dc == None:
            # sets new dc and clears it
            dc = wx.BufferedDC(wx.ClientDC(self.canvas), self._Buffer)
            dc.Clear()
}}}
with
{{{
        if dc == None:
            # sets new dc and clears it
            pdc = wx.BufferedDC(wx.ClientDC(self.canvas), self._Buffer)
            pdc.Clear()

            try:
                dc = wx.GCDC(pdc)
            except:
                dc = pdc
}}}
Now. This probably can be explored a little further:
  * replace the current rubberbox with a nice alpha blended one.
  * a flag to trigger the antialiased behaviour? Check the number of points?
  * only tested this in Windows and Linux/Ubuntu so far, so any compatibility reports welcome!

Screenshots. Here is an antialiased ezplot (compared to the normal plot)

And in ezplot.py, demo 8 (Draw8) shows error bars:
