#summary My additions to pyplot

= Introduction =

Yes, one could use matplotlib but sometimes, pyplot will do just fine... although a few tweaks here and there might be necessary. I thought I might as well publish all the tweaks in my very own (almost certainly useless) version of pyplot called... ezplot!


= Details =

Latest addition is antialiasing. Haven't really tested it as much as I would've liked. So far, I have noticed that it plays nicely with Ubuntu, not so nicely with XP. This will require more testing I guess!

Anyway, this warrants some screenshots, so here is an antialiased ezplot (compared to the normal plot)
