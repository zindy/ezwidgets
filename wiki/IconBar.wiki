IconBar shows a small icon with two bars in the taskbar.


This is how it looks like in Ubuntu:

And this is how it looks like in Windows XP:

Two things I found a bit of a bother:

wx.Icon doesn't expose the SetData() method, so the only way is to generate an image, then convert it to a bitmap then to an icon.

Windows insists on the icons being 16x16. If your icon is somewhat smaller than that (like mine was 15x16) you will need to pad it with a transparent colour.

The trick is to select a colour you will use for transparency, white in my case. then do
{{{
image = wx.EmptyImage(16,16)
image.SetData(s)
bmp = image.ConvertToBitmap()
bmp.SetMask(wx.Mask(bmp, wx.WHITE)) #sets the transparency colour to white
icon = wx.EmptyIcon()
icon.CopyFromBitmap(bmp)
}}}

The SetMask() makes the bitmap transparent where the pixels are white. Good news is, transparency is also transferred to the icon.
