= !JessyInk keyboard navigation =

See also JessyInkMouse for mouse navigation.

== In slide mode ==

Moving backward and forward using set transitions:
  * *space* move to the next slide
  * *left* and *right* move back and forward one slide

Moving backward and forward without transitions:
  * *up* and *down* move back and forward one slide
  * *page up* and *page down* move back and forward one slide

Switching to index mode:
  * *i* toggles from _slide_ to _index_ mode

== In index mode ==

Zooming in and out:
  * *0* reset zoom level (default zoom set to 4 slides across instead of 3?)
  * *-* zoom out (display more slides)
  * *+* or *=* zoom in (display less slides)

Moving around:
  * *up*, *down*, *left*, *right* arrows to select a slide
  * *page up* and *page down* move back and forward one page

Selecting a slide:
  * *i* or *enter* toggles from _index_ to _slide_ mode, selecting the highlighted slide

== Issues ==

There might be an issue with the *-*, *+*, *=* zoom keys on non-US keyboards. These shortcuts were designed on a UK keyboard (close enough to the US layout) and I have no idea if the keyboard shortcuts will work on other keyboards. Could someone with a French, German or any other non-US keyboard tell me if the zoom keys work and / or whether there might be other keys to consider.
